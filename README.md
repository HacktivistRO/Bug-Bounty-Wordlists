Hola!

I am ReconAte (RECON + automATE), authored by (Hacktivist R-O).

My job is to "automate your task of automation!"

#Setting me up is really simple. Just follow these steps:

1) After you have cloned me from GitHub, run "install.sh"; I'll gather all the things I require. (smart, huh?)
2) I'll clone all of the required tools (dropping the list below) into a directory.
3) After that I'll be creating a directory "ReconAte Outputs" to store my outputs. You'll get to know this better, once you use me!
4) Also, my master has curated some great wordlists for you, I'll get them too. You just have a walk around and allow me to take care of things. Please

#Using me is really simple:

2) From then onwards, just run:

	./reconate.sh yourtarget.com

1) I'll crawl your target for directories and files, using a custom wordlist and DirSearch and store it in a .txt file.
2) I'll crawl for Internal Admin Panels and store it in a .txt file.
3) Using Sublist3r, I'll enumerate subdomains from public resources.
4) Using crt.sh and certspotter, I'll discover some more subdomains.
5) Then I'll filter out unique subdomains (gathered from all tools) and store it in a .txt file.

#I use following resources to save your time during Reconnaissance: 

1) DirSearch (https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch)
2) Sublist3r (https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r)

#Along with these tools, my master has curated some wordlists for you from different sources like:
1) SecLists (https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)
2) wfuzz (https://github.com/xmendez/wfuzz)
3) enciphers (https://github.com/enciphers/Wordlists)

#Wishlist
1) Gathering more information using NMap
2) Adding KnockPy into subdomains enumeration phase
3) Using AWSBucketDump and AWSCLI for testing of publicly available AWS S3 Buckets 

#PS
Me and my master believe, "no one is perfect!". So, I love getting upgraded day-by-day and help you in a lot more of challenges you face during recon.
Both of just love feedback as we believe " Feedback is the breakfast of champions!". Weather good or bad, just let us know.

				      		SOOO. What are you waiting for? "Let's ReconAte!!"
